    "It is very easy to subclass `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier` if all you want to do is change the network graph: all you have to do is write a new `define_graph`. If your graph has new arguments that the user might want to set, then you should also redefine `__init__` so that these values are accepted and set as attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, please subclass `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier` so that it defines the following graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "h_{1} &= xW_{1} + b_{1} \\\\\n",
    "r_{1} &= \\textbf{Bernoulli}(1 - \\textbf{dropout_prob}, n) \\\\\n",

    "h_{3} &= h_{2}W_{2} + b_{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $r_{1}$ and $d_{1}$ define a dropout layer: $r_{1}$ is a random binary vector of dimension $n$, where the probability of a value being $1$ is given by $1 - \\textbf{dropout_prob}$. $r_{1}$ is multiplied element-wise by our first hidden representation, thereby zeroing out some of the values. The result is fed to the user's activation function $f$, and the result of that is fed through another linear layer to produce $h_{3}$. (Inside `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier`, $h_{3}$ is the basis for a softmax classifier, so no activation function is applied to it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, using this notation, `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier` defines the following graph:\n",

    "h_{2} &= f(h_{1}) \\\\\n",
    "h_{3} &= h_{2}W_{2} + b_{2}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code starts this sub-class for you, so that you can concentrate on `define_graph`. Be sure to make use of `self.dropout_prob`\n",
    "\n",

    "- **It's much more ambiguous.** Consider `\"directions from washington to canada\"`.  Does that refer to the State of Washington, or to the District of Columbia?  And where exactly in Canada are we headed?\n",
    "- **It can also be much messier.**  Because it's a real-world application, and because users ~~are idiots~~ make mistakes, travel queries can include lots of misspellings (such as `\"indianapolish\"`), mangled syntax, and other linguistic infelicities.  It's not all neat and tidy like the arithmetic case study.\n",

But, unlike the expression trees we looked at in the arithmetic case study, it does not need to contain arbitrarily deeply-nested recursive structure."

Because the dataset was quickly retracted by AOL, it can be difficult to find online, but it is currently available for download [here][aol-dataset].\n",

Remember, it was 2006.  The query \"facebook\" doesn't show up until position 119!)  To construct a query sample suitable for our purposes, we'll need to do some filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the queries we're interested in always refer to a location, we'll start by filtering for location names.  Recognizing location names is itself a hard problem, so for current purposes we'll adopt a good-enough solution: we'll grep the queries for the names of about 600 U.S. locations (cities, states, mountains, lakes, and so on) listed in [Geobase][].  (We'll be using Geobase again in the next unit.)  This winnows the 10M unique queries to about 1M.  It's a good start, but it's still not enough.  (The top five queries are now \"white pages\", \"florida lottery\", \"wells fargo\", \"whitney houston\", and \"las vegas\".)

    "    \"airline flights from raleigh durham to nashville tennessee\"\n",

    "    \"poem it takes courage to love from tyler perrys movie\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of observations here.  First, not all of the queries are actually travel queries.  That's OK — we actually *want* to include some queries which do not belong to the target domain.  Such \"negative\" queries are important for evaluating our system's ability to distinguish between queries it should be parsing and queries it shouldn't.  Second, there are a lot of mispelings.  Again, that's OK.  We want a *realistic* sample which reflects the inputs our system will actually encounter in its intended application.  Messy inputs are a fact of life, and they're one of the things that distinguishes this domain from the highly artificial example of natural language arithmetic we looked at in the last unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's still a problem, though.  Not all travel queries contain both \"from\" and \"to\".  Many valid travel queries contain only a destination, but no origin — and some contain an origin, but no destination.  If we relax the conjunction to a disjunction (that is, \"from\" *or* \"to\", we get about 23,000 queries, most of which are still not what we're looking for (for example, \"colorado rent to own\", \"moving to florida\").  However, the list of examples above (and its continuation, not shown) suggest many other terms we can usefully search for: \"airline\", \"flights\", \"distance\", \"mileage\", \"driving\", \"directions\", and so on.  We constructed a list of about 60 such terms (recorded in a comment in [`travel_examples.py`](travel_examples.py)).  We then selected queries which contain a location, either \"from\" or \"to\", and either one of the ~60 travel terms or both \"from\" and \"to\".  This left 6,588 queries, and the results look pretty good:\n",
    "\n",

    "Three of those are not really travel queries, but that's perfectly fine.\n",

The second is asking for the duration of a bus trip from Atlantic City to New York City.  And the third is asking for the cost of an airfare from Newark to Charleston.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a bit more formal, the following keys are allowed in the top-level map:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `domain` has one of two values: `travel` for travel queries, or `other` for non-travel queries.\n",
    "  - `type` specifies the type of information requested, one of: `directions`, `distance`, `duration`, `cost`, or `schedule`.\n",
    "  - `mode` specifies the mode of travel, one of: `air`, `bike`, `boat`, `bus`, `car`, `taxi`, `train`, or `transit`.\n",
    "  - `destination` specifies the destination of travel using a nested map representing a location.\n",
    "  - `origin` specifies the origin of travel using a nested map representing a location.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In nested maps representating locations, just two keys are allowed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `id` is an integer which is the unique identifier of the location in the [GeoNames][] geographical database.\n",

    "Note that our semantic representation both resolves ambiguity and canonicalizes.  One the one hand, the phrase \"`new york`\" has a different semantic representation if it refers to the city than if it refers to the state; on the other hand, \"`new york city`\" and \"`nyc`\" have the same semantic representation.  These qualities will make it easy for a downstream executor to turn a semantic representation directly into action.\n",

    "In a real-world application, the executor would likely be a module that translates our semantic representations into requests to backend APIs to compute optimal routes, retrieve bus schedules or airfares, or whatever.

For datasets of significant size, it is usually not practical for one person to do all the work.

Accordingly, one of the [exercises](#travel-exercises) at the end of this section will ask you to annotate a score of travel queries.\n",

    "Alternatively, if the annotation task does not require specialized knowledge, the work can often be distributed over workers on a crowdsourcing platform such as [Amazon Mechanical Turk][].  Our semantic representation for the travel domain is simple enough that the crowdsourcing approach might be feasible.  Of course, the workers wouldn't write down the semantics directly; rather, they'd fill out a carefully-designed form containing questions about the query, and a script would generate semantic representations based on their responses.  We leave working out the details of the crowdsourcing approach as an exercise for the motivated reader.  :-)\n",

    "The difficulty of producing annotated data, and the consequent paucity of such data, has been the eternal bane of research in semantic parsing.  Indeed, overcoming this obstacle was the chief motivation for the shift made by [Liang et al. 2011][] to learn not from semantics but from denotations, which are easier and cheaper to generate via crowdsourcing.  Despite this shift, annotated data remains scarce.  To this day, the largest standard dataset for semantic parsing (the [WebQuestions][] dataset) contains only 5,810 examples.\n",

You might find yourself quibbling with some of the annotation choices.  In some cases, our semantic representation is too impoverished to capture the user's intent completely.  For example, \"`scenic drive to duluth mn`\", \"`honeymoon trip to hawaii`\", and \"`jet blue flights to new york`\" contain modifiers which cannot be expressed in our semantic representation.  In other cases, the user's intent may be uncertain or obscure: what exactly does \"`airbus from boston to europe`\" mean?"

Because geocoding is a common need across many applications, many geocoding services are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such service is [GeoNames][].  GeoNames defines a large geographic database in which each location is identified by a unique integer.  For example, Boston is identified by [4930956][].  GeoNames also provides a free, [RESTful][] API for geocoding requests.  For example, a request to geocode \"Palo Alto\" looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the `GeoNamesAnnotator` uses a persistent cache which is pre-populated for phrases in the 100 annotated travel examples, avoiding the need for live calls to the GeoNames API.  However, if you run on any other examples, you will be making live calls.  By default, your requests will specify your username as `wcmac`.  That's fine, but each (free) GeoNames account is limited to 2000 calls per hour.  If too many people are making calls as `wcmac`, that quota could be exhausted quickly.  If that happens, you'll want to [create your own account](http://www.geonames.org/login) on GeoNames.\n",

    "You will soon observe that the annotations are far from perfect.  For example, \"`florida`\" is annotated as `{'id': 3442584, 'name': 'Florida, UY'}`, which denotes a city in Uruguay.  The current implementation of `GeoNamesAnnotator` could be improved in many ways.  For example, while the GeoNames API can return multiple results for ambiguous queries such as \"`florida`\", the `GeoNamesAnnotator` considers only the first result — and there is no guarantee that the first result is the best. It may also be possible to improve the quality of the results by playing with some of the API request parameters documented [here](http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html).  Some of the [exercises](#travel-exercises) at the end of this unit ask you to explore these possibilities.\n",

    "Several of these exercises ask you to measure the impact of your change on key evaluation metrics.  Part of your job is to decide which evaluation metrics are most relevant for the change you're making.  It's probably best to evaluate only on training data, in order to keep the test data unseen during development.  (But the test data is hardly a state secret, so whatever.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select 20 of the 6,588 queries in [aol-travel-queries.txt](./aol-travel-queries.txt) and manually annotate them with target semantics.  Select your queries using uniform random sampling — this will minimize overlap between different people completing this exercise, and therefore maximize the value of the aggregate labor.  (In Python, you can sample from a list using `random.sample()`.)  You will likely find some cases where it's not clear what the right semantics are.  Do your best.  The point of the exercise is to develop an awareness of the challenges of annotation, and to recognize that there's no such thing as perfectly annotated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many of the remaining errors on training examples occur because the origin isn't marked by \"from\".  Examples include \"`transatlantic cruise southampton to tampa`\", \"`fly boston to myrtle beach spirit airlines`\", and \"`distance usa to peru`\".  Extend the grammar to handle examples like these.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does your solution to the previous exercise handle examples where some other query element intervenes between origin and destination?  Examples include \"`university of washington transportation to seatac`\", \"`birmingham al distance from indianapolish in`\", and \"`nyc flights to buffalo ny`\".  If not, extend the grammar to handle examples like these.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current structure of the grammar permits parses containing any number of `$FromLocation`s and `$ToLocation`s, including zero.  Find a way to require that (a) there is at least one `$FromLocation` or `$ToLocation`, (b) there are not multiple `$FromLocation`s or `$ToLocation`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The travel grammar is lacking a scoring model, and it shows a big gap between accuracy and oracle accuracy.  Examine and diagnose some examples where accuracy is 0 even though oracle accuracy is 1.  Propose and implement a scoring model, and measure its efficacy in closing that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend `Grammar` to allow rules which mix terminals and non-terminals on the RHS, such as `Rule('$RouteQuery', '$TravelMode from $Location to $Location')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to improve the precision of the `GeoNamesAnnotator` by fiddling with the GeoNames API request parameters documented [here](http://www.geonames.org/export/geonames-search.html).  For example, the `featureClass`, `countryBias`, or `orderby` parameters seem like promising targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to improve the coverage of the `GeoNamesAnnotator` by enabling it to return multiple annotations for ambiguous location names.  Investigate the impact of varying the maximum number of annotations on various performance metrics, including accuracy, oracle accuracy, and number of parses.  How would you characterize the tradeoff you're making?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building on the previous exercise, implement a feature which captures information about the result rank of annotations generated by the `GeoNamesAnnotator`, and see if you can use this feature to narrow the gap between accuracy and oracle accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have probably noticed that one of our standard evaluation metrics is something called \"spurious ambiguity\".  Dig into the SippyCup codebase to figure out what spurious ambiguity is.  Here's a hint: it's something bad, so we want to push that metric toward zero.  Find a training example where it's not zero, and figure out why the example exhibits spurious ambiguity.  Are there changes we can make to the grammar to reduce spurious ambiguity?  Also, why is spurious ambiguity undesirable?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In its current form, the travel grammar parses lots of queries it shouldn't.  (By \"parses\", we mean \"generates a *positive* parse\".)  This problem is known as *overtriggering*.  The overtriggering problem is hard to observe on our tiny dataset of 100 examples, where most of the examples are positive examples.  Investigate overtriggering by downloading the AOL query dataset, identifying the 1,000 most frequent queries, and running them through the grammar.  How many cases of overtriggering do you find?  Can you suggest some simple changes to minimize overtriggering?  (Warning: the AOL dataset contains lots of queries which may be offensive.  Skip this exercise if you're not down with that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the queries \"`flights los angeles hawaii`\" vs. \"`flights los angeles california`\".  Despite the superficial resemblance, the second query seems to mean flights *to* Los Angeles, not flights *from* Los Angeles *to* California.  But the grammar can successfully interpret both queries only if it permits both interpretations for each query.  This creates a ranking problem: which interpretation should be scored higher?  Can you add to the scoring model a feature which solves the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop and execute a strategy to annotate all 6,588 queries in [aol-travel-queries.txt](./aol-travel-queries.txt) with target semantics using crowdsourcing.  Warning: this is an ambitious exercise."

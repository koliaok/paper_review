    "Our third case study will examine the domain of geography queries.  In particular, we'll focus on the [Geo880][] corpus, which contains 880 queries about U.S. geography.  Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  [Geo880]: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/geo.html\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"which states border texas?\"\n",
    "    \"how many states border the largest state?\"\n",
    "    \"what is the size of the capital of texas?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geo880 queries have a quite different character from the arithmetic queries and travel queries we have examined previously.  They differ from the arithmetic queries in using a large vocabulary, and in exhibiting greater degrees of both lexical and syntactic ambiguity.  They differ from the travel queries in adhering to conventional rules for spelling and syntax, and in having semantics with arbitrarily complex compositional structure.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"what rivers flow through states that border the state with the largest population?\"\n",
    "    \"what is the population of the capital of the largest state through which the mississippi runs?\"\n",
    "    \"what is the longest river that passes the states that border the state that borders the most states?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Geo880 was developed in Ray Mooney's group at UT Austin.  It is of particular interest because it has for many years served as a standard evaluation for semantic parsing systems.  (See, for example, [Zelle & Mooney 1996][], [Tang & Mooney 2001][], [Zettlemoyer & Collins 2005][], and [Liang et al. 2011][].)  It has thereby become, for many, a paradigmatic application of semantic parsing.  It has also served as a bridge between an older current of research on natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) (see [Androutsopoulos et al. 1995][]) and the modern era of semantic parsing.\n",

    "  \n",
    "The domain of geography queries is also of interest because there are many plausible real-world applications for semantic parsing which similarly involve complex compositional queries against a richly structured knowledge base.  For example, some people are passionate about baseball statistics, and might want to ask queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"pitchers who have struck out four batters in one inning\"\n",
    "    \"players who have stolen at least 100 bases in a season\"\n",
    "    \"complete games with fewer than 90 pitches\"\n",
    "    \"most home runs hit in one game\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental advocates and policymakers might have queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"which country has the highest co2 emissions\"\n",
    "    \"what five countries have the highest per capita co2 emissions\"\n",
    "    \"what country's co2 emissions increased the most over the last five years\"\n",
    "    \"what fraction of co2 emissions was from european countries in 2010\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Techniques that work in the geography domain are likely to work in these other domains too."

    "As usual, we'll adopt a data-driven approach.  The training examples include lots of words and phrases which refer to relations, both \"forward\" relations (like `\"traverses\"`) and \"reverse\" relations (like `\"traversed by\"`).  Guided by the training data, we'll write lexical rules which define the categories `$FwdRelation` and `$RevRelation`.  Then we'll add rules that allow either a `$FwdRelation` or a `$RevRelation` to be promoted to a generic `$Relation`, with semantic functions which ensure that the semantics are constructed with the proper orientation.  Finally, we'll define a rule for _joining_ a `$Relation` (such as `\"capital of\"`) with a `$Collection` (such as `\"vermont\"`) to yield another `$Collection` (such as `\"capital of vermont\"`).\n",

    "Several of these exercises ask you to measure the impact of your change on key evaluation metrics.  Part of your job is to decide which evaluation metrics are most relevant for the change you're making.  It's probably best to evaluate only on training data, in order to keep the test data unseen during development.  (But the test data is hardly a state secret, so whatever.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle queries which use the phrase \"how many people\" to ask about population.  There are many examples in the Geo880 training data.  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle counting questions, indicated by the phrases \"how many\" or \"number of\", as in \"how many states does missouri border\".  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Several examples in the Geo880 training dataset fail to parse because they refer to locations using names that, while valid, are not recognized by the `GeobaseAnnotator`.  For example, some queries use \"america\" to refer to `/country/usa`, but `GeobaseAnnotator` recognizes only \"usa\".  Find unannotated location references in the Geo880 training dataset, and extend the grammar to handle them.  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle examples of the form \"where is X\", such as \"where is mount whitney\" or \"where is san diego\".  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quite a few examples in the Geo880 training dataset specify a set of entities by name, as in \"how many states have a city named springfield\" or \"how many rivers are called colorado\".  Extend the grammar to handle these, leveraging the `TokenAnnotator` introduced in [Unit 2][].  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle phrases like \"austin texas\" or \"atlanta ga\", where two entity names appear in sequence.  Make sure that \"atlanta ga\" has semantics and a denotation, whereas \"atlanta tx\" has semantics but no denotation.  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In [Unit 2][], while examining the travel domain, we saw big gains from including rule features in our feature representation.  Experiment with adding rule features to the GeoQuery model.  Are the learned weights intuitive?  Do the rule features help?  If so, identify a few specific examples which are fixed by the inclusion of rule features.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find an example where using the `empty_denotation` feature causes a loss (a bad prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `empty_denotation` feature doesn't help on count questions (e.g., \"how many states ...\"), where all parses, good or bad, typically yield a denotation which is a single number.  Add a new feature which helps in such cases.  Identify a few specific examples which are fixed by the new feature.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.  [This exercise assumes you have already done the exercise on handling count questions.]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle comparisons, such as \"mountains with height greater than 5000\" or \"mountains with height greater than the height of bona\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building on the previous exercise, extend the grammar to handle even those comparisons which involve ellipsis, such as  \"mountains higher than \\[the height of\\] mt. katahdin\" or \"rivers longer than \\[the length of\\] the colorado river\" (where the bracketed phrase does not appear in the surface form!).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend the grammar to handle queries involving units, such as \"what is the area of maryland in square kilometers\" or \"how long is the mississippi river in miles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Geo880 training dataset contains many examples involving population density.  Extend the grammar to handle these examples.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Several examples in the Geo880 training dataset involve some form of negation, expressed by the words \"not\", \"no\", or \"excluding\".  Extend the grammar to handle these examples.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current grammar handles \"capital of texas\", but not \"texas capital\".  It handles \"has austin capital\", but not \"has capital austin\".  In general, it defines every phrase which expresses a relation as either a `$FwdRelation` or a `$RevRelation`, and constrains word order accordingly.  Extend the grammar to allow any phrase which is ordinarily a `$FwdRelation` to function as a `$RevRelation`, and vice versa.  Can you now handle \"texas capital\" and \"has capital austin\"?  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What if we permit any word to be optionalized by adding the rule `Rule('$Optional', '$Token')` to our grammar?  (Recall that `$Token` is produced by the `TokenAnnotator`.)  Measure the impact of this change on key evaluation metrics.  You will likely find that the change has some negative effects and some positive effects.  Is there a way to mitigate the negative effects, while preserving the positive effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The success of the `empty_denotation` feature demonstrates the potential of denotation features.  Can we go further?  Experiment with features that characterize the *size* of the denotation (that is, the number of answers).  Are two answers better than one?  Are ten answers better than two?  If you find some features that seem to work, identify a few specific examples which are fixed by your new features.  Measure the impact on key evaluation metrics.\n",

    "1. Because `GeobaseAnnotator` relies on exact string matching, it isn't very robust.
